# Deep-Learning-
Here is a deep learning CNN model which makes use of various libraries such as tensorflow and numpy to train itslef.
Basically it's an image classifier which classifies images of builidings, forests, mountains, glacier, sea, streets with an accuracy of around 94%.
This model takes a time of around 110 minutes to train itself.
You can find the data set from the link provided below:

This model is trained over 14000 photos of training set and around 3000 photos for validation.

Check out the code and do let me know how i can improve it.
